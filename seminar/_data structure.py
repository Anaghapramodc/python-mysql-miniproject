data structure
data can be arranged in a many ways,logical or mathamatical arrangementof a data is called data strucure
eq:-array,linkedlist,stack,queue,tree,graph
data structures are 2 types-->primitive:-int,float,string
                              non primitive:-linear--->Static-->array
                                                       Dinamic-->linked list
                                                                 stack

traversing:-access each record exactly once so that certain items in the record may be processed.
searching:-find the location of the record with a given key value.
inserting:-adding a new record to the structure
